[![It's a me](https://profiles.cache.lol/phils/picture)](https://phils.omg.lol)

Iâ€™ve been working with Microsoft Technologies since 1997, including Visual Basic, C++, .NET, Access, SharePoint, and SQL Server. My many years of industry experience is backed by a degree in Computer Science.

I have designed, implemented, and managed OLTP, data warehousing, and OLAP data systems. During these projects, I was able to flex multiple disciplines. From database design, ETL, Power BI, and reporting.

My most recent experience has focused on creating technical content to help get other developers up-to-speed. Recent projects include writing instructor-led content for courses focused on SQL Server, both on-premises and in Azure.

I used to hand-craft my blog hosted on GitHub and served by Netlify. I now trust [prami](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/phils) with all me web type projects. Check out my [current status](https://phils.status.lol) for example.
