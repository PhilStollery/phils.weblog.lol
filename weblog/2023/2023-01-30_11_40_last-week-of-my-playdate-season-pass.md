# Last week of my playdate season pass ðŸ˜¢

[![Ratcheteer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilStollery/phils.weblog.lol/master/images/ratcheteer.png)](https://play.date/games/ratcheteer/) 

[Ratcheteer](https://play.date/games/ratcheteer/) is **the** game this week. I was struggling and had put it down. The thing I missed was turning the crank with a spanner activates some machines in the world. I unlocked the power station and then got stuck again. 

Quick google (Duck Duck Go failed to find this) got me to the maker's [website](http://shauninman.com/playdate/ratcheteer/). So I know where to go when I'm stuck again. The hints are really well done. 

I hope this helps you too.
