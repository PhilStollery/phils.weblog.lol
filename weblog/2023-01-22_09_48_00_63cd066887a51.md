# Introduction

Realised my [about](https://me.stollerys.co.uk) link in my navigation should just be my omg.lol page. Therefore I wanted a longer intro post, like I've seen on mastodon. 

I have to blame my parents for my love of tech. They bought my brother and I an Amstrad CPC 464. I think I was maybe 8. They typed in programmes from magazines. I loved it. In my mind I said to myself, "I want to earn money using one of these. All the time. I want to do computers". As I grew older I added a Sega Master System, Amiga, and then IBM PCs. 

My school let me down, no G.C.S.E in computing. The closest I got to IT was a class in business studies, which equalled Excel. However, I knew I could study Computer Science at Uni. So I aimed my A Levels at getting enough points and relevance to get in.  

Since Uni I’ve been working with Microsoft Technologies, from Visual Basic, C++, .NET, Access, SharePoint, and backed by SQL Server. Always loved the web but didn't go that path. I got paid for IT in big business. 

So I've designed, implemented, and managed OLTP, data warehousing, and OLAP data systems. During these projects, I was able to flex multiple disciplines. From database design, ETL, Power BI, and reporting.

Now I get paid to focus on creating technical content to help get other developers get up-to-speed. Recent projects include writing instructor-led content for courses focused on SQL Server, both on-premises and in Azure. It has enabled me to visit the head office of Microsoft in Seattle to help shape their job role description of a SQL Admin.

I wanted to put my knowledge sharing skills to the test, and really believe there should be more diversity within tech. So I spent 8 weeks [teaching girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) about SQL. 

My personal tech life is very different. All Apple from my iPhone to MacBook Air. I have no free ear time, they are filled with [podcasts](https://phils.omg.lol/now) if I’m not talking to my family or watching TV. I have an [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bab-club-search/id1526804928) in the App Store and built websites for friends and [charity](https://wotton-firework-display.co.uk/).
